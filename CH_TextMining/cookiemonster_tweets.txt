When people take me picture, why dey tell me to say “cheese?" Me smile more if me say “cooooo-kie!”
While eating delicious Sesame seed cookie, me wondered: what do Sesame seeds grow into?
Me had philosophical moment: what if there no such thing as cookies? What would dat make me? Dis da stuff dat keep me up at night.
